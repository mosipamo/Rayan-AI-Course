# HW1: Fraud Detection Analysis (SVM & Logistic Regression)

This project uses an imbalanced dataset with 284,807 transactions, of which only 492 are fraudulent (0.172%), to detect fraud using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Logistic Regression.

## Dataset Overview
- **Total transactions**: 284,807
- **Fraudulent transactions**: 492 (0.172%)

## Methodology

### 1. Data Loading
Data is shuffled for better separation before analysis.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key steps include:
- Displaying summary statistics
- Visualizing class imbalance
- Computing a correlation matrix
- Plotting feature distributions

### 3. Preprocessing
Steps to prepare the data include:
- Handling missing values
- Detecting outliers using boxplots
- Normalizing features
- Applying Isolation Forest and IQR for outlier detection

### 4. Model Training
Two models are used for fraud detection:
- **Logistic Regression**: For binary classification
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Suitable for imbalanced data

### 5. Evaluation
The models are evaluated based on:
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1 Score**


- HW2: Neural Networks and Deep Learning (CNN, Classification, Regression)
- HW3: Variational Autoencoder (Stable Diffusion)
